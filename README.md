This is the *updated* version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game that The Odin Project assigned. Updating the project to be web-based was honestly a little frustrating, but the challenge was fun overall! Any feedback is greatly appreciated! The old console based project can be found in the "old" branch. Enjoy!
